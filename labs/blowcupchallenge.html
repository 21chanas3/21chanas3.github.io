            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this experiment, we will be attempting to find out what are the optimal conditions to perform the Blow Cup Challenge in. The Blow Cup Challenge involves three cups, a launch cup, projectile cup and a target cup. The aim is to get the projectile cup from the launch cup to the target cup, by blowing in space between the launch and projectile cup.</p>
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>I predict that if we use a large solo cup filled with 75% water as the launch cup and place the target cup 5 cm away from the launch cup, it will be optimal for the challenge. This is because I think by filling it up to the 75% mark, it requires less distance to launch out of the cup. I think placing it 5cm away would be optimal because we might blow the cup a bit too hard.</p>

            <h2>Observation</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Tests with water at 50% were conducted first, then tests with water at 75%.</li>
              <li>Tests with distance at 1 cm were conducted first, then test with distance at 5 cm.</li>
              <li>Each time a cup is successfully blown out of the launch cup, a small amount water from the launch cup is also ejected</li>
            </ul>
